        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Icy cold coffee is simply the best beverage to enjoy on a hot summer day. Even though I tend to be more of a tea drinker, I do love a good cup of coffee occasionally - and this cafe-style blended coffee drink is my favorite!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon instant coffee-powder or granules</li>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 to 4 tablespoon raw sugar or add as required</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk-cold or chilled</li>   
            <li>6 to 8 ice cubes or as needed - optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender take your instant coffee, raw sugar, add warm water.</li>
            <li>Blend for a minute or until the coffee solution becomes frothy and the brown color lightens a bit.</li>
            <li>Add 6 to 7 ice cubes. For a thick cold coffee, you can reduce the ice cubes from 2 to 4.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups cold milk.</li>
            <li>Whole milk gives a slightly thicker consistency and is richer. You can opt to make the cold coffee with skimmed milk or low-fat milk. If you decided to add either, then reduce the ¼ cup water to about 2 to 3 tablespoons.</li>
            <li>Blend for 1 to 2 minutes or until the milk is mixed evenly with the coffee concoction and you see a nice frothy layer on top.</li>
            <li>Pour in glasses and serve cold coffee. The frothy top layer will settle into the beverage as it sits, so it's best to enjoy blended iced coffee right away.</li>
        </ol>
